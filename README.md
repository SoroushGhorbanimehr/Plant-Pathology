# Plant-Pathology - FGVC7 Competition


This repository contains my solution for the "Plant Pathology 2020 - FGVC7" competition, where the goal is to diagnose plant diseases using leaf images. The diseases include categories like "healthy," "scab," "rust," and "multiple diseases." Early diagnosis is crucial for improving crop yield and reducing hunger worldwide.


## Project Highlights:

- Data Visualization:  Using Matplotlib and Plotly to explore and understand the dataset.
- Image Processing & Augmentation:  Techniques like edge detection, flipping, and blurring implemented with OpenCV to enhance model performance.
- Modeling:  Utilizing pre-trained Keras models like DenseNet, EfficientNet, and EfficientNet NoisyStudent for disease classification.
- Ensembling:  Combining the predictions of multiple models to improve accuracy and robustness.


This project demonstrates the power of deep learning in plant disease detection and showcases various techniques for preprocessing, model training, and validation.

Feel free to explore, and contributions are welcome!
